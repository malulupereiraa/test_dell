Test Description: 

"Dear Developer

Congratulations on coming this far, now it's time for a technical evaluation.

Through this assessment, we will be evaluating your ability to manipulate the DOM and some basic knowledge about web development.

    General Exercises

The DOM manipulation assessment consists of three exercises and for each of them, we will provide a URL that will serve as the basis for you to perform code manipulations.

Two of them must be written in Vanilla JS while the other you'll need to use the jQuery library. Which one? It's up to you :)

    Exercise 1
    Exercise 2
    Exercise 3

Important Instructions

    The answers for the General Exercises should be delivered on a single text/markdown file.

    All the code that you'll write should be runnable into the browser's console, in other words, everything must be done with JavaScript.

    The exercises shall be delivered through a GitHub repository (do not create a Pull Request);

    You should deliver each exercise into different files;"
